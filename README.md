# ZombieDash

The goal of the game is for you, Penelope Dolittle, zombie hunter, to bring all the citizens to safety via the exit on every level before they are infected and turned into Zombies themselves. After you rescue all the citizens, you must go to the exit yourself, continuing on to the next level. Once all the citizens are saved on the final level the game finishes. Killing some zombies in the process as well as maintaining the safety of the citizens contribute to your final score.

The game is built for MacOS using XQuartz to help with the display
